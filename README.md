This project, prepared by Turya Ganguly, delves into the Indian Railways dataset, providing an extensive analysis of one of the world's largest railway networks. By leveraging advanced data analytics and geospatial techniques, it highlights insights into railway operations, infrastructure, and geographical spread.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In-depth exploration of railway zones, station distributions, and operational attributes.
Insights derived from station names, codes, zones, and other key metrics.
Geospatial Analysis
Mapping the geographic distribution of railway stations across India.
Integration of railway station data with state boundaries for state-wise insights.
Visualizations
Detailed graphical representations of the railway network overlaid on India's administrative map.
Insights into station densities, zone demarcations, and spatial overlaps.
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handling invalid and missing geometries to ensure data quality.
Converting spatial data into valid GeoDataFrames for precise analysis.
Tech Stack
Python Libraries: Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn.
Geospatial Data: Shapefiles for state boundaries and station locations.
Observations
Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of stations.
Northern Railway serves the most stations.
Passenger trains are the most common train type.
Howrah Junction handles the most train arrivals and departures.
MSB (Chennai Beach) is the most common departure station, while VLCY (Velachery) is the most frequent arrival station.
Applications
This project offers actionable insights for:

Transportation Planning: Optimizing routes and schedules.
Infrastructure Development: Identifying areas for expansion and improvements.
Policy-Making: Data-driven decisions for railway operations.
